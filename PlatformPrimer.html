          <h4>Platform Engineering</h4>
          <p>
            Platform Engineering is a term used to describe the work performed
            by teams composed of infrastructure, software engineering, and
            devops engineers engaged in building enterprise platforms for
            developer enablement. Great...What's a platform? A platform is a
            grouping of software and infrastructure technologies arranged to
            provide a holistic developer experience. Still too vague? Let's
            break it down further by exploring how platforms are divided:
          </p>
          <p>
            There are somewhat differing views on this division. We'll find
            PlatformEngineering.org's separation contains fewer planes than
            Microsoft MVP Steve Buchanan's view, however all of the technologies
            and the capabilities they provide are present in both models.

            <li>Developer Control Plane</li>
            <li>Integration & Delivery Plane</li>
            <li>Resource Plane</li>
            <li>Monitoring & Logging Plane</li>
            <li>Security Plane</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Steve Buchanan<sup>2</sup></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Resource Plane</li>
            <li>Management Plane</li>
            <li>Integration & Delivery Plane</li>
            <li>Interface Control Plane</li>
            <li>State Plane</li>
            <li>Monitoring Plane</li>
            <li>Security Plane</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
          Although the latter model of a platform contains 2 additional planes,
          they can be explained as abstractions of planes found in the former
          model. The Management Plane is simply contained within the Resource
          Plane in the PlatformEngineering.org model. Likewise, the State Plane
          is split between Platform Engineering's Resource Plane and Integration
          & Delivery Plane.
